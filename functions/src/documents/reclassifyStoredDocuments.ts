/**
 * A write path for the § 11 classifier (#204).
 *
 * The classifier shipped inert: `documentType` is written only at extraction
 * time, so nothing already stored carries one, the receipt-only chase queue
 * answers zero rows, and the scorer's duplicate-suppression rule has never
 * run against real data. The verdict exists on every read and is thrown away
 * every time, because nothing persists it.
 *
 * This re-runs the SAME classifier over stored records and persists the
 * answer. It regenerates no rules: `classifyFileRecord` and
 * `deriveDocumentationState` are the ones extraction and the transaction
 * trigger already use, so a sweep can never disagree with a fresh extraction.
 *
 * Files and transactions move together, in that order, in one call.
 * `documentationState` is derived only when a transaction is touched, so a
 * transaction holding no files never gets one at all — and splitting the two
 * would leave a window where a file reads `receipt` while its transaction
 * still says nothing.
 *
 * The population is every record the caller owns, soft-deleted files
 * included: the classification is a property of the document, a restore does
 * not re-extract, and a file left out here would come back unclassified. The
 * write itself is inert for the file triggers — `matchFilePartner` and
 * `matchFileTransactions` gate on the extraction and partner-match flags, none
 * of which this touches, so a swept corpus does not re-run matching.
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does not do:
 *  - it never touches an extraction field. Only the three classification
 *    fields are written, so a hand correction (#184) cannot be destroyed and
 *    no record is stamped as corrected when a machine merely re-read it.
 *  - it does not write a value that did not move. An unchanged write re-fires
 *    `onTransactionUpdate` for nothing, which is the loop every write path
 *    here is built to avoid — and it is what makes a second run free.
