/**
 * Is this document a *Rechnung* under § 11 UStG, or only a payment
 * confirmation? (#104)
 *
 * Pure: plain facts in, verdict out. No Firestore handle, no model call, no
 * I/O — a sibling in style to `uva/calculateUva.ts`, and for the same reason.
 * The whole rule table is here so it can be tested exhaustively without
 * fixtures or network.
 *
 * Austrian law has two invoice regimes and the threshold between them is this
 * discriminator's hinge:
 *
 *   § 11 Abs 6 — Kleinbetragsrechnung, gross total up to 400 EUR. Issue date,
 *   supplier name and address, quantity and description, delivery date or
 *   period, *Entgelt und Steuerbetrag in einer Summe*, and the Steuersatz. No
 *   supplier UID. No sequential number. No recipient.
 *
 *   § 11 Abs 1 — over 400 EUR. All of the above, plus a fortlaufende Nummer
 *   (lit. h), the supplier's UID (lit. i), and the recipient's name and
 *   address (lit. b) — with the recipient's UID additionally required over
 *   10 000 EUR.
 *
 * So below the threshold the discriminator is the VAT rate alone. Applying
 * the UID test there would demote every legitimate small invoice and fill the
 * chase queue with work that does not exist.
 *
 * The document's own printed heading is evidence, never the verdict: a
 * document titled `Rechnung` that fails § 11 at its amount is classified on
 * the structure, with the title recorded in the basis.
