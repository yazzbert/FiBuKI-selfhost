/**
 * Kick off the initial IMAP sync for a freshly connected mailbox.
 *
 * ## Why this is a standalone module
 *
 * On Firebase this work belongs to the `onMailServiceConnected` Firestore
 * trigger, and that is still where it runs. On a self-host deployment the
 * trigger cannot fire for this write at all: trigger delivery rides the
 * in-process bus (`functions/src/selfhost/bus.ts`), whose auto-drain is enabled
 * only by the API entrypoint (`functions/src/selfhost/server.ts`). The IMAP
 * connect route runs in the *web* container, so the `emailIntegrations` write
 * lands on a bus with no handlers registered and the initial sync is never
 * queued — the mailbox connects, reports success, and then silently does
 * nothing forever. `functions/src/selfhost/change-notify.ts` already predicts
 * exactly this: the in-process bus "does not cross process boundaries [...] and
 * it would silently work in single-replica development while failing in any
 * deployment with a separate worker."
 *
 * The sync *queue*, unlike the bus, is a Firestore collection that the API
 * container polls, so a queue item written by any process is picked up
 * normally. Only the enqueue needed a home reachable from both containers.
 *
 * Deliberately imports no `firebase-functions` symbol: the web build aliases
 * `firebase-admin/firestore` to the self-host shim but has no shim for the
 * Functions SDK, so pulling one in here would drag Firebase into a
 * Firebase-free bundle.
