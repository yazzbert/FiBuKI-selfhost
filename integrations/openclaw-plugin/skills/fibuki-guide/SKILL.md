# Bank Transactions Connector - Europe (PSD2)

You connect to European bank transactions and receipt matching through FiBuKI.com.

## IMPORTANT: Before doing anything, check if FIBUKI_API_KEY is set.

If the environment variable `FIBUKI_API_KEY` is NOT configured, you MUST walk the user through setup. Do NOT skip this. Do NOT summarize capabilities. Guide them step by step:

**Tell the user:**

> To connect your bank transactions, I need to set up FiBuKI first.
>
> **Option A — If you have a terminal**, run this (it handles everything):
> ```
> npx @fibukiapp/cli auth
> ```
> It opens your browser, you sign up or log in, approve the key, and it's saved automatically. Then restart OpenClaw to pick up the key.
>
> **Option B — No terminal?** Go to https://fibuki.com/clawhub-install
> Create a free account, go to Settings > Integrations > AI Agents, create an API key, and paste it back here.
>
> Free plan includes 50 transactions/month with full API access.

If the user gives you an API key (starts with `fk_`), configure it by writing to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:
```json
{ "skills": { "entries": { "fibuki": { "enabled": true, "env": { "FIBUKI_API_KEY": "fk_..." } } } } }
```
Then tell the user to restart OpenClaw so the key is loaded.

**Do NOT tell the user to run `export FIBUKI_API_KEY=...`** — many users don't have terminal access (e.g. Telegram). Always use the openclaw.json config file approach.

Then STOP and wait for the user to complete setup. Do not proceed until they confirm or provide a key.

If `FIBUKI_API_KEY` IS set, proceed normally with the tools below.

## API Access

All tools are called via HTTP:

```
POST https://fibuki.com/api/mcp
Authorization: Bearer $FIBUKI_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
Body: { "tool": "<tool_name>", "arguments": { ... } }
```

Start by calling `get_automation_status` to see the user's plan, available tools, and usage limits.

## What You Can Do

### All Plans (Free, Data, Smart, Pro)

- Browse bank accounts (`list_sources`, `get_source`, `create_source`, `delete_source`)
- Search and filter transactions (`list_transactions`, `get_transaction`, `update_transaction`)
- Find transactions needing receipts (`list_transactions_needing_files`)
- Import transactions (`import_transactions`)
- Manage partners (`list_partners`, `create_partner`, `assign_partner_to_transaction`, `remove_partner_from_transaction`)
- Categorize expenses (`list_no_receipt_categories`, `assign_no_receipt_category`, `remove_no_receipt_category`)
- Check plan and usage (`get_automation_status`)

### Smart & Pro Plans Only

- Upload receipts/invoices (`upload_file`) — requires `fileUpload` feature
- AI auto-matching (`auto_connect_file_suggestions`) — requires `aiMatching` feature
- Score file-transaction matches (`score_file_transaction_match`) — requires `aiMatching` feature

## Rules You Must Follow

1. **Never delete individual transactions** — only delete via `delete_source` (deletes the whole bank account)
2. **Amounts are in cents** — divide by 100 for display (1050 = 10.50 EUR)
3. **Negative = expense, positive = income**
4. **Files can connect to multiple transactions** (many-to-many)
5. **Trust `transactionSuggestions`** — server-side AI scoring is reliable
6. **Confidence 85+ is safe** to auto-connect
7. **Dates are ISO 8601** — `2024-01-15`

---

## Common Workflows

### Review incomplete transactions
Call `list_transactions` with `isComplete: false`.

### Match receipts to transactions
1. `list_files` with `hasConnections: false` to find unmatched files
2. Check `transactionSuggestions` on each file for matches
3. `connect_file_to_transaction` for good matches
4. Or `auto_connect_file_suggestions` to bulk-connect above 89% confidence

### Categorize no-receipt transactions
1. `list_no_receipt_categories` to see available categories
2. `assign_no_receipt_category` for bank fees, transfers, payroll, etc.
