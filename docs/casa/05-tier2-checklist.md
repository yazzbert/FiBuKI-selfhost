## Remediation queue

1. ~~Add the missing response-security headers (V9.1, V14.4).~~ ✅ Done — `next.config.ts` now sets CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy.
2. ~~Run a SAST scan (CodeQL).~~ ✅ Done — 0 findings across 200 rules on 2026-06-22. Re-runs weekly + per-PR. See [07-sast-remediation-report.md](./07-sast-remediation-report.md).
3. ~~Close all critical and high dependency CVEs.~~ ✅ Done — `npm audit fix` cleared 4 critical + 17 high. Remaining moderates documented in [dependency-audit-2026-06.md](./dependency-audit-2026-06.md).
4. Verify the new CSP does not break OAuth popups, Firebase Auth IdP iframe, or App Check; tighten by removing `'unsafe-inline'`/`'unsafe-eval'` if not required at runtime.
5. Submit `fibuki.com` to the HSTS preload list (https://hstspreload.org) once the header has been live for 2 weeks.
6. Run OWASP ZAP baseline against prod; record findings in [08-dast-remediation-report.md](./08-dast-remediation-report.md). Requires PR #29 to land first so the workflow can be dispatched.
7. Confirm Firebase App Hosting does not serve `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on static assets (orbis gotcha) — verified during ZAP run.

## ASVS coverage statement

Of the 134 ASVS v4.0 Level 1 requirements, FiBuKI maps:
- 105 as MET with evidence in this repo,
- 6 as PARTIAL pending documentation,
- 19 as N/A with justification,
- 4 as TODO (DAST run, HSTS preload submission, CSP runtime verify, App Hosting CORS audit).

The remediation queue above closes the TODOs within the planned Tier 2 submission window.
