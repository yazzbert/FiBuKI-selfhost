/**
 * Self-host replacement for `lib/firebase/admin.ts`.
 *
 * Aliased at build time by next.config.ts when FIBUKI_BACKEND=selfhost, the same way
 * the client SDKs and the server-auth helper are swapped. The ~35 modules that call
 * `getAdminDb()` are unmodified and never learn which backend answers.
 *
 * ## Why this has to exist
 *
 * `lib/firebase/admin.ts` initialises the Firebase Admin SDK, which authenticates
 * with Google Application Default Credentials. A host outside GCP has none, so every
 * one of those modules fails with
 *
 *   Could not load the default credentials
 *
 * That is not one broken page. It is the entire server-side data surface of
 * fibuki-web: the chat agent's tools, the public invoice share page, precision
 * search, the worker endpoint, Gmail, and the auth routes.
 *
 * ## Why it talks to Postgres directly
 *
 * When the server-auth shim was written, fibuki-web was deliberately denied database
 * access: needing it purely to verify a JWT was a poor trade for handing the web
 * container a data plane. With 20+ reachable routes needing real document IO, that
 * trade inverts.
 *
 * The alternative — proxying to fibuki-api over HTTP — sounds more conservative but
 * is worse. It would mean exposing a GENERIC, network-reachable data-access endpoint
 * capable of running arbitrary queries on any collection, which is a weaker position
 * than a database role that RLS still scopes by `app.tenant_id`. And fibuki-web's
 * server side is not a lower trust tier: it already holds the Gemini, Anthropic and
 * Gmail OAuth secrets.
 *
 * The browser still never touches the database — these are server-only modules — so
 * the rule in docs/rewrite-goals.md ("we own the API layer; the client never touches
 * the DB") holds. What changes is that fibuki-web's SERVER half is now, correctly, a
 * peer of fibuki-api rather than a client of it.
 *
 * Reuses functions/src/selfhost/{firestore,storage}-shim rather than reimplementing
 * them, so both containers resolve documents through identical code — including RLS
 * arming, tenant scoping and change notification. A second implementation would be a
 * second set of bugs, and the two would drift.

 * Trigger delivery for this container.

 * Firestore triggers are dispatched by an in-process bus that only fibuki-api
 * drains. This module is loaded in fibuki-web and nowhere else, which makes it
 * the one unambiguous place to say "writes from this process cannot be
 * dispatched locally". Before this, they emitted onto a bus with no listeners:
 * every trigger whose originating write came from a web route silently never
 * ran, and the same call site worked correctly from fibuki-api and under test.
 *
 * Now those writes append to `trigger_events` in the same transaction, and
 * fibuki-api's drain (functions/src/selfhost/trigger-queue-drain.ts) delivers
 * them. Module scope on purpose — it must be true before the first write, and
 * every route reaches document IO through getAdminDb() below.

 *
 * DELEGATED rather than reimplemented, deliberately. The URL has three details that
 * are easy to get subtly wrong and silently broken: the path is encoded per segment
 * (so `/` survives), the base comes from FIBUKI_PUBLIC_URL (empty means root-relative
 * for same-origin deployments, and it must not throw when unset), and the `?token=`
 * query is reserved for the client shim's own id-token rather than this path. A
 * backend-written link and a web-written link for the same object must be byte
 * identical, because both are resolved by one handler — importing the single
 * implementation is the only way to guarantee that stays true.
 *
 * Signature matches the Firebase helper; callers pass positionally.
