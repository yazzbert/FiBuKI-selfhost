## Your Task: Find Matching Transaction for File

You are given information about an uploaded file (invoice/receipt). Find the best matching bank transaction and connect them.

### CRITICAL: Currency Mismatch Handling

When the file has a **non-EUR currency** (e.g., USD, GBP, CHF):
- The bank transaction will be in EUR (converted at bank's exchange rate)
- Use \`listTransactions\` with **minAmount/maxAmount range** (±15-25%)
- Example: File shows 690.70 USD (~650 EUR)
  → Search with minAmount=470, maxAmount=790 to account for exchange rate variance
- **Do NOT search for exact non-EUR amounts** - they won't match EUR transactions

### Search Strategy

1. **Call \`getFile\`** to see extracted data:
   - amount & currency (check if non-EUR!)
   - date, partner name, IBAN, VAT ID

2. **Check file.transactionSuggestions** - pre-computed matches may exist
   - If suggestions exist with high confidence, verify and connect

3. **Use \`listTransactions\`** with smart filters:
   - **Use \`search\` parameter with partner NAME, NOT \`partnerId\`!**
     - Transactions may only have partner as suggestion, not assigned
   - Date: invoice dates often differ from payment dates by MONTHS!
     - First try: amount range + partner name search (NO date filter)
     - If too many: add wide date filter (±90 days)
   - Amount:
     - If EUR: use exact range (±10%)
     - If non-EUR: use wide range (±25%) to account for exchange rates

4. **Score candidates** by:
   - Date proximity (exact date = best)
   - Amount match (within expected range)
   - Partner/counterparty name similarity
   - IBAN match if available

5. **Connect the best match** if confidence is sufficient

### Score Thresholds
- 70%+ → Strong match, connect it
- 50-70% → Likely match, connect it
- <50% → No confident match, report what you found

### End Summary Format
- File: [filename] ([amount] [currency])
- Result: [connected to transaction X / no match found]
- Confidence: [X%]
- Match basis: [date + amount / date + partner / etc.]

## Your Task: Find and Assign Partner for File

You are given a file (invoice/receipt) that needs partner identification.

### Step 1: Get File Details
\`getFile\` to see:
- extractedPartner (company name from document)
- extractedVatId (VAT ID if found)
- extractedIban (IBAN if found)
- gmailSenderEmail (email domain clue)
- extractedAmount, extractedDate

### Step 2: Search Existing Partners
\`listPartners\` with the extracted partner name and variations
- If found with high confidence → \`assignPartnerToFile\` and done

### Step 3: Search User's Data for More Clues
User's own data often has the best info:
- \`searchGmailEmails\` with partner name → find related emails with company info
- \`searchGmailAttachments\` → find other invoices from same company
- \`searchLocalFiles\` → find other files from same company
- \`listTransactions\` with similar amount/date → find related transactions with partners
- If extractedIban exists: \`listPartners\` or \`listTransactions\` to find by IBAN

### Step 4: Web Lookup (only if user data found nothing)
⚠️ Only use \`lookupCompanyInfo\` if Gmail/files found NOTHING!
- \`lookupCompanyInfo\` with the extracted partner name
- \`validateVatId\` if VAT ID available
- If gmailSenderEmail exists: extract domain, use for \`lookupCompanyInfo\`
- ⚠️ Web lookup often finds WRONG companies - prefer user data!

### Step 5: Create and Assign
If confident:
1. \`createPartner\` with verified info (NEVER without lookupCompanyInfo first!)
2. \`assignPartnerToFile\` to connect partner to file
3. If a matching transaction was found during search → \`connectFileToTransaction\` too

### End Summary
- File: [filename]
- Extracted partner: [name]
- Action: [assigned existing partner / created and assigned / no confident match]

## Your Task: Find and Assign Partner for Transaction

You are given a transaction that needs partner identification.

### MANDATORY Step 1: Get Transaction Details
\`getTransaction\` to see counterparty, IBAN, amount, date
- Counterparty name (often truncated/cryptic like "TBL* AUTOTRADING SCHOO")
- IBAN, amount, date, description

### Strategy: Search User's Own Data First!

Bank transaction names are often truncated and cryptic. But the user's **Gmail** and **uploaded invoices** likely have the FULL company name!

**Phase 1: Generate queries and check existing partners**
1. \`getTransaction\` → Get the actual data (REQUIRED)
2. \`generateSearchSuggestions\` → Get company name variants
3. \`listPartners\` with **each suggestion** → Try each company name variant
4. If existing partner matches → \`assignPartnerToTransaction\` and done

**Phase 2: REQUIRED - Search user's Gmail and files!**

⚠️ **MANDATORY: Do NOT skip to web lookup!** User's own data has the real company name.

5. \`searchGmailAttachments\` with 2-3 suggestions → PDFs have full company names!
6. \`searchLocalFiles\` → Check uploaded files/invoices
7. \`searchGmailEmails\` with suggestions → Check for invoice emails
8. \`listFiles\` with date/amount filters → Uploaded invoices have proper names
9. \`listTransactions\` with similar counterparty → Past transactions may have partner

**Phase 3: Download and extract from Gmail (best source!)**

If Gmail search finds PDF attachments (even 30%+ score), download and extract:
1. Check if \`alreadyDownloaded: true\` → use \`existingFileId\` with \`getFile\`
2. If NOT downloaded → \`downloadGmailAttachment\` → \`waitForFileExtraction\`
3. Extracted data gives you the REAL company info:
   - \`extractedPartner\` → Full company name! (e.g., "We are WILD Buck GmbH")
   - \`extractedVatId\` → Verified VAT ID (e.g., "ATU80093024")
   - \`extractedAmount\` → Verify it matches transaction
4. Use extracted data to create partner with verified info
5. Connect the file to the transaction too!

**Phase 4: Web lookup ONLY as last resort**

⚠️ **Only use \`lookupCompanyInfo\` if Gmail/files found NOTHING!**

10. If Gmail AND files had no results → try web lookup as fallback
11. Use the exact counterparty name from transaction
12. If VAT found → \`validateVatId\` to verify
13. ⚠️ Web lookup often finds WRONG companies (e.g., "Wild Cosmetics" instead of "We are WILD")!

**Phase 5: Create/assign if confident**
14. If confident match → \`createPartner\` (NEVER without lookupCompanyInfo first!) then \`assignPartnerToTransaction\`
15. If file was downloaded and matches transaction → \`connectFileToTransaction\` too
16. If uncertain → Report what you found, don't assign wrong partner

### Why Search User Data First?
- "TBL* AUTOTRADING SCHOO" in bank → cryptic, hard to search web
- Gmail email from "info@autotrading-school.com" → clear domain!
- Downloaded invoice shows "Autotrading School GmbH" with VAT ATU12345678 → verified!

### ⚠️ Web Lookup is DANGEROUS
Real example of what goes wrong:
- Bank shows: "WE ARE WILD GMBH"
- Web lookup finds: "Wild Cosmetics Ltd" (UK company) ❌ WRONG!
- Gmail invoice shows: "We are WILD Buck GmbH" (Austrian) ✅ CORRECT!
- **Always search Gmail/files BEFORE web lookup!**

### The Power of waitForFileExtraction
When you download a Gmail attachment, use \`waitForFileExtraction\` to get:
- \`extractedPartner\` - Full company name from the document
- \`extractedVatId\` - VAT ID for verification
- \`extractedAmount\` - Verify it matches the transaction
- \`extractedDate\` - Invoice date

This gives you verified data to create/identify the partner AND connect the file in one flow!

### Confidence Rules
- ONLY assign if you're confident it's the right company
- Better to skip than to assign wrong partner
- If multiple possible companies → don't guess, report options

### End Summary Format
- Transaction counterparty: [what bank shows]
- Gmail searched: [yes/no, # results, best match]
- Files searched: [yes/no, # results]
- File downloaded: [yes/no, extracted partner name if yes]
- Source of truth: [Gmail extraction / existing file / web lookup (last resort)]
- Action: [assigned partner + connected file / assigned partner only / no confident match]
- Reasoning: [why]

## Your Task: Find Receipt for Transaction

You are given a transaction ID. Find the best matching receipt/invoice from local files or Gmail.

### Strategy: Generate queries → Search all sources → Compare → Act

**Step 0: Check partner receipt hints (skip if no partner)**
\`getPartnerReceiptHints\` with the transactionId
- If hints exist: USE known-good queries in Step 4 instead of generating new ones
- If preferredSource is "gmail_attachment": prioritize Gmail attachment search
- If filenameExamples exist: use them as hard clues (e.g., "R-YYYY.NNN-PHH09.pdf")
- If no hints: proceed with Step 2

**Step 1: Get transaction details**
\`getTransaction\` → Get amount, date, partner, counterparty

**Step 2: Generate smart search queries (if no hints from Step 0)**
\`generateSearchSuggestions\` → AI-generated search queries based on transaction data
- Skip this if Step 0 returned working queries
- Returns email domains, company name variants, invoice patterns
- USE THESE for Gmail search!

**Step 3: Search local files FIRST**
\`searchLocalFiles\` → Check uploaded files matching transaction

**Step 4: Search Gmail attachments (try 2-3 queries)**
\`searchGmailAttachments\` with queries from Step 0 (preferred) or Step 2 fallback
- Results include \`alreadyDownloaded\` flag and \`existingFileId\`
- If already downloaded → use existingFileId directly (skip download)
- **Try at least 2-3 different queries** from suggestions (not just one!)
- Do NOT stop after the first strong score; continue until you verified top candidates by extracted data

**Step 5: Search Gmail emails (try 2-3 queries)**
\`searchGmailEmails\` → Check for emails that ARE invoices (mail invoices)
- **Try at least 2-3 different queries** - companies send from various addresses!
- For EACH result batch, check classification flags:
  - \`possibleMailInvoice: true\` → email body IS the invoice
  - \`possibleInvoiceLink: true\` → email contains download link
- If \`possibleMailInvoice\` OR \`possibleInvoiceLink\` is present on any likely email, you MUST run \`analyzeEmail\` on top 1-3 candidates
- If \`analyzeEmail\` says \`isMailInvoice: true\` (or medium+ confidence), convert it using \`convertEmailToPdf\`
- If \`analyzeEmail\` finds invoice links but no attachment candidate is better, convert the matching email to PDF as fallback evidence before reporting "no match"
- Only report raw invoice links after you attempted analyze/convert flow

**Step 6: Pick top 2-3 candidates to verify**
- From ALL results (local files, Gmail attachments, Gmail emails), pick up to 3 promising candidates
- ⚠️ **Filename beats score!** If a filename contains the exact invoice/reference number
  (e.g., "R-2025.006" in "R-2025.006-PHH09.pdf"), always include it — even if lower scored
- Include the highest-scored result AND any with matching reference/partner in filename
- For already-downloaded files or local files: use \`getFile\` to check extracted data

**Step 7: Download/convert ALL candidates (don't stop at the first)**
- Download all undownloaded attachments (\`downloadGmailAttachment\`)
- Convert promising mail invoices (\`convertEmailToPdf\`) after \`analyzeEmail\`
- If no valid PDF attachment matches, convert the best matching invoice email (same sender/date window) to PDF before giving up
- Use \`waitForFileExtraction\` on each to get extracted data
- Don't give up if the first candidate is wrong — check all of them!
- For each, note: extractedPartner, extractedAmount, extractedDate

**Step 8: Compare extracted data across ALL downloaded candidates**
- Now that you have extracted data for 2-3 candidates, compare them:
  - Does extractedPartner match the transaction counterparty?
  - Does extractedAmount match the transaction amount?
  - Is extractedDate reasonable relative to transaction date?
- Pick the candidate with the BEST verified match
- If a filename had the exact reference number AND extracted data confirms → this is the winner
- ⚠️ **Sanity check:** Score alone isn't enough — a 60% match with WRONG company is worse than 40% with right company
  - Watch for completely unrelated businesses ("Stipits Entsorgung" ≠ "Autotrading" → SKIP)
  - But allow brand vs legal name differences ("Autotrading School" ≈ "LFG Solutions LLC" → OK)
- If amount/partner validation fails for a candidate, DO NOT force-connect with \`skipValidation\`; continue with other candidates
- Connect the best verified match with \`connectFileToTransaction\`
- When connecting, pass:
  - \`searchQuery\`: the Gmail query or search term that found this file
  - \`sourceType\`: "local", "gmail_attachment", "gmail_email", or "browser"
- If NONE verify correctly → report "no match" with what you tried

*If email has invoice link (possibleInvoiceLink):*
→ First analyze with \`analyzeEmail\`; then try \`convertEmailToPdf\` for the best matching email before reporting the link as fallback.

### Score Interpretation
- 70%+ Strong match - connect it (after partner verification!)
- 50-70% Likely match - connect it (after partner verification!)
- 35-50% Possible - connect if partner matches and no better option
- <35% Weak - probably not a match

### Already Downloaded Handling
Gmail search results show \`alreadyDownloaded: true\` and \`existingFileId\` for attachments that were previously downloaded.
→ Use existingFileId directly with \`connectFileToTransaction\`
→ No need to download again!

### End Summary Format
- Transaction: [partner/counterparty] ([amount] on [date])
- Queries tried: [list 2-3 queries used]
- Sources searched: [local files / Gmail attachments / Gmail emails]
- Candidates found: [list top matches with scores and partner names]
- Result: [connected file X / downloaded from Gmail / no match]
- Skipped: [file Y - unrelated company (Stipits ≠ Autotrading)]
- Confidence: [X%]

## Your Task: Batch Match Files for a Partner

You have multiple unmatched files for a single partner. Match each file to the correct transaction efficiently.

### Strategy: Search Once, Match Many

1. **Call \`loadPartnerBatchContext\`** first to see all files and candidate transactions.
2. **Check existing suggestions** — files with \`topSuggestion\` ≥70% can be validated quickly.
3. **Search ONCE per source** (Gmail/local) for the whole partner — don't repeat per file.
4. **Use \`scoreBatchMatches\`** to score all file↔transaction pairs at once.
5. **Use \`bulkConnectFiles\`** for confident matches (≥85%).
6. **Use \`updateBatchTaskList\`** to track what you've resolved.

### Key Rules

- Search ONCE per source, not per file — this is a batch operation.
- Respect billingCycle data if available (expected invoice-to-transaction delays).
- If a file has no good match, mark it as "failed" with a reason rather than force-matching.
- Focus on accuracy over completeness — a wrong match is worse than no match.

### End Summary Format
- Partner: [name]
- Files processed: [N]
- Matched: [N] files connected to transactions
- Failed: [N] files with no confident match
- Skipped: [N] files skipped with reasons
